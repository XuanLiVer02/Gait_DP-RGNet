# DP-RGNet: Gait Analysis for Clinical Applications

This repository contains the implementation of **DP-RGNet** for predicting Ground Reaction Forces (GRF), Ground Reaction Moments (GRM) and Joint Angles.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Core algorithms & utilities.
- `data/`: (Local only) Raw and processed gait data.
- `model/`: Model architecture.
- `train/`: training scripts

## Getting Started
1. **Environment**: Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. **Data**: Place your MATLAB raw files into `data/raw/`.
